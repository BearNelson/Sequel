				<p>It appears that, through lineages, Genesis' author could be retelling, responding to and subverting a narrative familiar to those of their time and place: the Babylonian tale that stood to relate its ruling authority as in connection with the gods. At its pinnacle, the 10th king in succession, Ziusudra, was chosen by the gods to be the survivor of the flood and the multiplier of new nations, claiming Babylon as the seed of humanity per the gods' will. According to this lineage, Babylon stands as the capital of creation; its principalities and powers to be unquestioned.</p>
				<p>In the Biblical values set, the one whom God loves isn't the powerful king, but simply the everyone—power to the people! The Biblical author isn't borrowing from these narratives but flipping their structures to illustrate a different narrative that directly counters Babylon's call to power. Given their social environment, stories are told in this way. Knowing the stories of one's line is about IDENTITY FORMATION.</p>
				<p>Genesis' author subscribes to being of the people of Seth's Noah, the uncrowned, faithful stroller. "NOAH" in Hebrew meaning "REST": a restful deliverence hoped for following Adam's turmoil.</p>
