						<p>This sets up the MACRO-PLOT for the rest of the Hebrew Bible: A TALE OF TWO SEEDS. It's as if every generation, every book is somehow replaying this primal conflict between the woman and the serpent. Who will, through life, defeat evil? Will it be Noah? He fails. Abraham? He fails. Moses? He fails. Who then can overcome trial and crush the serpent? We are to anticipate the coming of a messiah who can.
						<br>
						<br>In every generation, God’s election sets someone apart from their family, so that they can become vehicles for blessing others. This initiates a long-standing theme of sibling rivalry:</p>

				<p class=bot>Each of these chosen people has at least one un-chosen brother who becomes hostile. “Elect” does not equal “righteous,” nor does “unchosen” equal “unrighteous.” The chosen people often fail to bring God’s blessing to others, so God often elevates people from the non-chosen nations to bring blessing to the chosen.<br><br>Israel is elected to bless the nations. Kenites, Canaanites, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Samaritans—they’re all descendants of Israel’s siblings—often it's those from these non-elect nations who especially trust Yahweh. These stories show us that a person’s ethnicity or assumed lineage plays no part in their value to God. What matters most to God is how we choose to relate to him in our role to bless others.<br><br>
				These themes especially convulge on the micro level at the story of David and Goliath. Young David, the divinely-elected underdog, faces the hostile and older opponent, leader of armies, Goliath. David is of the seed of the woman; Goliath is depicted as the seed of the snake. Goliath is exorbitantly described as "BRONZE"; bronze is spelled using the root Hebraic letters of the word "SNAKE". Also, Goliath's ARMOR is described as SCALES! Then David crushes and cuts off his HEAD! Interestingly enough, David is the only person besides Jesus to be called a messiah, meaning "anointed one". Though, he was later in life unable to avoid partaking of and defeating malign chaos itself to implement order—the new creation—like one later in his line could.</p>
